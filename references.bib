    abstract = "{A fast micromagnetic simulator (FastMag) for general problems is presented. FastMag solves the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation and can handle multiscale problems with a high computational efficiency. The simulator derives its high performance from efficient methods for evaluating the effective field and from implementations on massively parallel graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures. FastMag discretizes the computational domain into tetrahedral elements and therefore is highly flexible for general problems. The magnetostatic field is computed via the superposition principle for both volume and surface parts of the computational domain. This is accomplished by implementing efficient quadrature rules and analytical integration for overlapping elements in which the integral kernel is singular. Thus, discretized superposition integrals are computed using a nonuniform grid interpolation method, which evaluates the field from N sources at N collocated observers in O(N) operations. This approach allows handling objects of arbitrary shape, allows easily calculating of the field outside the magnetized domains, does not require solving a linear system of equations, and requires little memory. FastMag is implemented on GPUs with ?\\&gt;GPU–central processing unit speed-ups of 2 orders of magnitude. Simulations are shown of a large array of magnetic dots and a recording head fully discretized down to the exchange length, with over a hundred million tetrahedral elements on an inexpensive desktop computer.}",

abstract = {The modified Green function appropriate for solution of interior boundary value problems of Laplace's equation in a three-dimensional rectangular parallelepiped, subject to periodic boundary conditions, is developed. This allows the determination of the potential due to an arbitrary continuous charge distribution and its periodic replications in three dimensions. Summation of the eigenfunction expansion by application of the Poisson-Jacobi formula gives a Ewald sum, while application of the Poisson summation formula results in a two-dimensional potential that is perturbed by a rapidly converging Fourier cosine series involving K0 Bessel functions. The latter constitutes a generalization of formulae described by Lekner. Numerical results show that the K0 expansion is more rapidly convergent than the Ewald sum, and could therefore substantially reduce the computational effort involved in the molecular simulation of ionic and polar fluids. The Green function is also shown to be related to the asymptotic behaviour of lattice sums for the screened Coulomb potential, in the limit as the screening constant tends to zero.}

This is a crucial feature when studying the influence of the microstructure on the performance of composite materials, which is demonstrated by hysteresis calculations of soft magnetic structures that are operated in a closed magnetic loop configuration. The applied differential formulation is perfectly suited for the application of true periodic boundary conditions.

The way it has been handled by previous investigators has often involved long running times or full matrices. In this paper, we take the demagnetizing energy into account by calculating the scalar potential φ associated with the demagnetizing field. This involves the calculation of another unknown φ in a problem which already has three unknowns: the components of the magnetization. By using φ, the problem is now uncoupled and the sparsity of the matrices is preserved. The magnetic structures studied here are thin slabs. We want to perform the calculations only on a small part of the slab. Since φ is defined in the whole space, the problem reduces to determining boundary conditions. By assuming that each unknown is periodic within the two directions in the plane of the slab, the domain of the problem reduces to a rectangular cell. The equations given in Ref. 1 are discretized by the finite‐element method and boundary elements are taken on the upper and lower surface to evaluate the scalar potential. This paper will outline the steps of the calculation of φ.}",

The solver, which relies on a 2-D fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based algorithm and a sparse preconditioner to reduce computational complexity, is parallelized using three workload decomposition strategies, including a pencil decomposition that increases the scalability of the computationally dominant FFT-based multiplication stage. A set of increasingly difficult benchmark problems, which require network parameter computations for Ntrace1 to 257 package-scale interconnects, are solved on a petaflop scale computer to quantify the solver's accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The total serialized computation time is observed to scale asymptotically as . For the largest problem, using ~1.14 million unknowns and 1536 processes, the solver requires a wall-clock time of ~0.05 s per iteration, ~1 minute per excitation, ~9 h per frequency, and ~424 hours to extract the 514-port network parameters at 40 sample frequencies between 1 to 40 GHz.},

abstract = {This paper presents a parallel algorithm implemented on graphics processing units (GPUs) for rapidly evaluating spatial convolutions between the Helmholtz potential and a large-scale source distribution. The algorithm implements a non-uniform grid interpolation method (NGIM), which uses amplitude and phase compensation and spatial interpolation from a sparse grid to compute the field outside a source domain. NGIM reduces the computational time cost of the direct field evaluation at N observers due to N co-located sources from O(N2) to O(N) in the static and low-frequency regimes, to O(NlogN) in the high-frequency regime, and between these costs in the mixed-frequency regime. Memory requirements scale as O(N) in all frequency regimes. Several important differences between CPU and GPU implementations of the NGIM are required to result in optimal performance on respective platforms. In particular, in the CPU implementations all operations, where possible, are pre-computed and stored in memory in a preprocessing stage. This reduces the computational time but significantly increases the memory consumption. In the GPU implementations, where handling memory often is a critical bottle neck, several special memory handling techniques are used to accelerate the computations. A significant latency of the GPU global memory access is hidden by implementing coalesced reading, which requires arranging many array elements in contiguous parts of memory. Contrary to the CPU version, most of the steps in the GPU implementations are executed on-fly and only necessary arrays are kept in memory. This results in significantly reduced memory consumption, increased problem size N that can be handled, and reduced computational time on GPUs. The obtained GPU–CPU speed-up ratios are from 150 to 400 depending on the required accuracy and problem size. The presented method and its CPU and GPU implementations can find important applications in various fields of physics and engineering.}

CNGTDA leverages the observation that transient wave fields generated by temporally bandlimited and spatially confined source constellations can be recovered via interpolation from appropriately delay- and amplitude-compensated field samples. This property is used in conjunction with a multilevel scheme, in which the computational domain is hierarchically decomposed into subdomains with sparse non-uniform grids used to obtain the fields. For both surface and volumetric source distributions, the computational cost of CNGTDA to compute the transient field at Ns observation locations from Ns collocated sources for Nt discrete time instances scales as O(NtNslogNs) and O(NtNslog2Ns) in the low- and high-frequency regimes, respectively. Coupled with marching-on-in-time (MOT) time domain integral equations, CNGTDA can facilitate efficient analysis of large scale time domain electromagnetic and acoustic problems.}

We restrict our attention here to the Poisson, modified Helmholtz, Stokes and modified Stokes equations. The approach extends to the oscillatory equations of mathematical physics, including the Helmholtz and Maxwell equations, but we will address these in a companion paper, since the nature of the problem is somewhat different and includes the consideration of quasiperiodic boundary conditions and resonances. Unlike lattice sum-based methods, the scheme is insensitive to the unit cell's aspect ratio and is easily coupled to adaptive fast multipole methods (FMMs). Our analysis relies on classical “plane-wave” representations of the fundamental solution, and yields an explicit low-rank representation of the field due to all image sources beyond the first layer of neighboring unit cells. When the aspect ratio of the unit cell is large, our scheme can be coupled with the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to accelerate the evaluation of the induced field. Its performance is illustrated with several numerical examples.}

              evaluation of electrostatic potentials with periodic boundary

              real-space and Fourier-space parts, and the Fast Fourier
              Transform (FFT)-based Spectral Ewald (SE) method is used to
              accelerate computation of the latter, yielding the total runtime

              solution technique for the free-space Poisson problem. The
              computational cost is further reduced by a new adaptive FFT for
              the doubly and singly periodic cases, allowing for different
              local upsampling factors. The SE method is most efficient in the
              triply periodic case where the cost of computing FFTs is the
              lowest, whereas the rest of the algorithm is essentially
              independent of periodicity. We show that removing periodic
              boundary conditions from one or two directions out of three will
              only moderately increase the total runtime, and in the free-space

              periodic case. The Gaussian window function previously used in
              the SE method is compared with a new piecewise polynomial
              approximation of the Kaiser-Bessel window, which further reduces
              the runtime. We present error estimates and a parameter selection
              scheme for all parameters of the method, including a new estimate
              for the shape parameter of the Kaiser-Bessel window. Finally, we
              consider methods for force computation and compare the runtime of
              the SE method with that of the fast multipole method.",

              solving the free-space harmonic and biharmonic equations using
              fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on a uniform grid (Vico et al. in

              point sources on a grid. With precomputation of a scalar grid
              quantity that does not depend on these sources, the amount of
              oversampling of the grids with Gaussians can be kept at a factor
              of two, the minimum for aperiodic convolutions by FFTs. The
              resulting algorithm has a computational complexity of $$O(N

abstract = {A fast and spectrally accurate Ewald summation method for the evaluation of stokeslet, stresslet and rotlet potentials of three-dimensional Stokes flow is presented. This work extends the previously developed Spectral Ewald method for Stokes flow to periodic boundary conditions in any number (three, two, one, or none) of the spatial directions, in a unified framework. The periodic potential is split into a short-range and a long-range part, where the latter is treated in Fourier space using the fast Fourier transform. A crucial component of the method is the modified kernels used to treat singular integration. We derive new modified kernels, and new improved truncation error estimates for the stokeslet and stresslet. An automated procedure for selecting parameters based on a given error tolerance is designed and tested. Analytical formulas for validation in the doubly and singly periodic cases are presented. We show that the computational time of the method scales like O(Nlog⁡N) for N sources and targets, and investigate how the time depends on the error tolerance and window function, i.e. the function used to smoothly spread irregular point data to a uniform grid. The method is fastest in the fully periodic case, while the run time in the free-space case is around three times as large. Furthermore, the highest efficiency is reached when applying the method to a uniform source distribution in a primary cell with low aspect ratio. The work presented in this paper enables efficient and accurate simulations of three-dimensional Stokes flow with arbitrary periodicity using e.g. boundary integral and potential methods.}

abstract = {A new theory of Wood's anomalies is presented which is based on a guided wave approach rather than the customary multiple scattering procedure. This approach provides both new insight and a method of calculation. It is shown that two distinct types of anomalies may exist: a Rayleigh wavelength type due to the emergence of a new spectal order at grazing angle, and a resonance type which is related to the guided complex waves supportable by the grating. A general theoretical treatment is presented which makes use of a surface reactance to take into account the standing waves in the grating grooves, and which derives the locations and detailed shapes of the anomalies. Rigorous results are obtained for a specific example; the amplitudes of all of the spectral orders are determined explicitly, and the Wood's anomaly effects are demonstrated clearly in graphical form for a variety of cases.},

abstract={Boundary integral equations are an important class of methods for acoustic and electromagnetic scattering from periodic arrays of obstacles. For piecewise homogeneous materials, they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in complicated geometries. They also satisfy the radiation condition for the scattered field, avoiding the need for artificial boundary conditions on a truncated computational domain. By using the quasi-periodic Green's function, appropriate boundary conditions are automatically satisfied on the boundary of the unit cell. There are two drawbacks to this approach: (i) the quasi-periodic Green's function diverges for parameter families known as Wood's anomalies, even though the scattering problem remains well-posed, and (ii) the lattice sum representation of the quasi-periodic Green's function converges in a disc, becoming unwieldy when obstacles have high aspect ratio.},
